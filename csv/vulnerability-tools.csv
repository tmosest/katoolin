"#","Tool","What it does","How it works (high‑level)"
"1","bbqsql","Performs blind SQL‑injection attacks on web applications.","Sends crafted SQL payloads that cause time delays or error messages; then parses responses to infer database structure."
"2","bed","Exploits Blind SQL injection on a specific web‑app template (the “Bed” project).","Uses a custom payload set to extract data bit‑by‑bit by observing the application’s behaviour."
"3","cisco-auditing-tool","Audits Cisco ASA, VPN, and other Cisco devices for misconfigurations.","Connects via SSH/Telnet, downloads config files, and runs a series of checks against known hard‑coded rule sets."
"4","cisco-global-exploiter","Executes a set of known exploits against Cisco products.","Uses pre‑built modules that send malformed packets or commands to trigger CVE‑related bugs."
"5","cisco-ocs","Audits Cisco OCS (Open Connect Server) devices.","Queries SNMP/OAS and parses device data for known vulnerabilities or weak settings."
"6","cisco-torch","Performs a wide‑range vulnerability scan on Cisco gear.","Emulates Cisco‑specific traffic patterns, checking for outdated firmware or insecure default settings."
"7","copy-router-config","Copies configuration files from routers (mostly Cisco).","Logs in via SSH/Telnet, runs “show run”, and saves the output locally."
"8","stasinopoulos","(Not a mainstream tool – likely a custom script by user Stasinopoulos)","Presumed to be a custom audit/scan utility; check its source for details."
"9","dbpwaudit","Audits web‑apps for database password storage vulnerabilities.","Looks for common passwords, default DB credentials, and weak hashing schemes."
"10","doona","Searches for the “Doona” web‑server (a legacy vulnerable HTTP daemon).","Performs a TCP SYN scan on ports 80/8080 and checks banner strings for the Doona signature."
"11","dotdotpwn","Exploits the “dotdot” vulnerability in Windows “\.\pipe” named pipes.","Injects crafted payloads into named pipes to trigger code execution or privilege escalation."
"12","greenbone-security-assistant","GUI client for Greenbone Vulnerability Management (OpenVAS).","Connects to a Greenbone server, submits scans, and renders results via a web UI."
"13","gsd","Generic Scan &amp; Discover tool (used for device discovery).","Sends ICMP, ARP, and UDP probes to map a network and identify open services."
"14","hexorbase","Reverse‑engineering tool for binary files (hex dump + analysis).","Loads binaries, displays raw hex, cross‑references symbols, and highlights patterns."
"15","inguma","PHP web‑shell that can be used for post‑exploitation.","Deploys as a backdoor; exposes a web UI for command execution, file uploads, etc."
"16","jsql","SQL injection scanner for Java‑based web apps.","Injects Java‑specific SQL payloads and parses application responses."
"17","lynis","Security audit tool for Linux/Unix systems.","Runs a large set of local checks (file permissions, package updates, kernel config) and prints a score/report."
"18","nmap","Network mapping and port scanner.","Sends SYN/UDP/NULL/FIN/ACK probes, then parses responses to infer OS, services, and vulnerabilities."
"19","ohrwurm","Exploits a specific OpenSSH “Ohrwurm” vulnerability (CVE‑2016‑0777).","Crafts a malicious SSH message that triggers a memory‑corruption bug."
"20","openvas-cli","Command‑line interface for OpenVAS (GVM).","Submits scans, polls status, and retrieves reports via the GVM API."
"21","openvas-administrator","Web UI for OpenVAS management.","Provides user/role management, target creation, and policy configuration."
"22","openvas-manager","Core daemon that runs OpenVAS scanners.","Executes vulnerability checks based on NVTs (Network Vulnerability Tests) and stores results."
"23","openvas-scanner","The actual scanner engine used by OpenVAS.","Launches NVTs as separate processes, connects to target hosts, and logs findings."
"24","oscanner","OS detection and exploitation scanner (old tool, not used much).","Sends crafted packets to guess OS type, then applies OS‑specific exploits."
"25","powerfuzzer","Fuzzer for Windows PowerShell scripts.","Generates random or mutated PowerShell commands to find bugs or misconfigurations."
"26","sfuzz","System‑call fuzzer for Linux.","Calls Linux syscalls with random parameters to trigger crashes or information leaks."
"27","sidguesser","Generates and tests valid Snort IDS rule SID ranges.","Probes a Snort installation with incremented SIDs to discover gaps or conflicts."
"28","siparmyknife","SIP protocol fuzzing and exploitation tool.","Sends malformed SIP packets to SIP servers, looking for buffer overflows or crashes."
"29","sqlmap","Automated SQL injection and database takeover.","Brute‑forces payloads, exploits DBMSs, extracts data, and can pivot to remote shell."
"30","sqlninja","Exploits SQL Server via blind injection.","Uses a set of exploits to extract data, dump tables, and ultimately spawn a shell."
"31","sqlsus","SQL injection framework (Python).","Performs injection attacks, data extraction, and optionally gets a shell on MySQL/PostgreSQL."
"32","thc-ipv6","IPv6 reconnaissance and scanning suite.","Generates IPv6 addresses, pings, port‑scans, and enumerates routers/interfaces."
